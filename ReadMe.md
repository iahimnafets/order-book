Introduction
A limit order book stores customer orders on a price time priority basis. The highest bid and lowest oer

    are considered "best" with all other orders stacked in price levels behind. In this test, the best order is consid-
    ered to be at level 1.

    Part A
    Given the following Order class create an OrderBook class to provide ecient limit order book capabilities.

    public class Order {
        private long id ; // i d o f o r d e r
        private double price ;
        private char side ; // B "Bid " o r O " O f f e r "
        private long size ;
        public Order (long id , double price , char side , long size ) {
            this.id=id;
            this.price = price;
            this.size= size;
            this.side = side;
        }
        public long getId ( ) { return id ; }
        public double getPrice ( ) { return price ; }
        public long getSize ( ) { return size ; }
        public char getSide ( ) { return side ; }
    }
    Your OrderBook class should support the following use-cases:
            • Given an Order, add it to the OrderBook (order additions are expected to occur extremely frequently)

• Given an order id, remove an Order from the OrderBook (order deletions are expected to occur at ap-
proximately 60% of the rate of order additions)

• Given an order id and a new size, modify an existing order in the book to use the new size (size modi-
cations do not eect time priority)
• Given a side and a level (an integer value >0) return the price for that level (where level 1 represents the
best price for a given side). For example, given side=B and level=2 return the second best bid price
• Given a side and a level return the total size available for that level
• Given a side return all the orders from that side of the book, in level- and time-order
Part B
Please suggest (but do not implement) modications or additions to the Order and/or OrderBook classes
to make them better suited to support real-life, latency-sensitive trading operations.

1) Unzip the .ZIP file

2) Import into IntelliJ as an existing project

3) Open the "terminal" tab in IntelliJ and run the command:
     mvn clean install

4) Open the class: "MyApplication" and launch the 
    application ( testing by swagger ) or use directly the class: JavaMainTest

5) Open in browser and paste this string:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config#/

7) Now you can test via swagger or run directly the class: JavaMainTest
