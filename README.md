Introduction

A limit order book stores customer orders on a price time priority basis. The highest bid and lowest oer

are considered "best" with all other orders stacked in price levels behind. In this test, the best order is consid-
ered to be at level 1.

Part A
Given the following Order class create an OrderBook class to provide ecient limit order book capabilities.
  
public class Order {
    private long id;
    private double price;
    private char side;
    private long size;

    public Order(long id, double price, char side, long size) {
        this.id = id;
        this.price = price;
        this.side = side;
        this.size = size;
    }

    public long getId() {
        return id;
    }
    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }
    public char getSide() {
        return side;
    }
    public long getSize() {
        return size;
    }
}

Your OrderBook class should support the following use-cases:
• Given an Order, add it to the OrderBook (order additions are expected to occur extremely frequently)

• Given an order id, remove an Order from the OrderBook (order deletions are expected to occur at ap-
proximately 60% of the rate of order additions)

• Given an order id and a new size, modify an existing order in the book to use the new size (size modi-
cations do not eect time priority)
• Given a side and a level (an integer value >0) return the price for that level (where level 1 represents the
best price for a given side). For example, given side=B and level=2 return the second best bid price
• Given a side and a level return the total size available for that level
• Given a side return all the orders from that side of the book, 
in level- and time-order

Part_B:

Please suggest (but do not implement) modications or additions to the Order and/or OrderBook classes
to make them better suited to support real-life, latency-sensitive trading operations.
